        <p>This delicious &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; slow-cooker dip is a game changer for any parties. It uses only three ingredients: sausage, Rotel, and cream cheese.</p>
        <p>I tried this dip for the first time at a friend&rdquo;s get-together and decided to make a double portion for my upcoming party. The entire Crockpot was empty by the end of the night!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound breakfast sausage</li>
            <li>1 can of Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies, drained</li>
            <li>1 8oz. package of cream cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the sausage in a large skillet over medium heat, breaking it up into small pieces as it&rsquo;s cooking. For best results, at this point, you&rsquo;ll want to drain off any excess grease. However, I&rsquo;ve found that when I use Jimmy Dean hot sausage, the excess oil is very minimal, so I just skip doing this.</li>
            <li>Now is the time to decide whether you want to continue your prep on the stovetop (fastest) or in your crockpot (best for transporting a hot dip to a tailgate party or potluck). If you&rsquo;re continuing on the stovetop, just leave the browned sausage in the skillet and dump in 2 cans of Rotel.</li>
            <li>Cube two 8-oz. blocks of cream and add them to the sausage Rotel mixture. Cook over medium-low heat on the stovetop until fully combined, stirring frequently.

                If you&rsquo;re preparing this dip in the crockpot, the cook time will take longer. You can use any heat setting, depending on how soon you plan to serve it. Just turn it down to &ldquo;keep warm&rdquo; after the ingredients are fully combined to avoid scorching it.</li>
        </ol>
